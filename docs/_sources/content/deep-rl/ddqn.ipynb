    "> The original paper introducing Double Deep Q-Learning, was published by authors from Google DeepMind back in 2016. Its title: \"Deep Reinforcement Learning with Double Q-Learning\". In this section, we explain how techniques used in this paper improve upon the standard Deep Q-Learning agent. We also show how one can implement the algorithm, and how to apply it to a problem.\n",
