# Interactivity

Interactive pages can be distinguished by the "\[Interactive\]" tag behind the title. These pages have additional
functionalities that can be explored, such as simulations. Since these simulations are made using code, we provide
specific instructions to show how to make them interactive, such as by tuning experimental parameters. Please take a
look at the figures below for more information on how to do this.

Using Simulations with Jupyter Notebooks
```

After clicking on the rocket-shaped button, follow the steps below to use interactivity:
1. Click on "COLAB"
2. When the file has opened in Google Colaboratory, go to "Runtime -> Run All" as in the image below:
```{figure} ../images/user-guide-sim-ra.png

```
3. Scroll down until you see a block with the parameters like in the image below
```{figure} ../images/user-guide-sim-pa.png
:alt: Clicking Run All
:class: bg-primary mb-1
:width: 100%
:align: center
```
4. Change any of the parameters in this block depending on your goals, and press the play button on the top left of the 
block. Alternatively, you can select the block and press "CTRL + ENTER". The code will now be executed, and you should
see the results afterwards.
